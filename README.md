# NodeForge
NodeForge is a dynamic node editor built in python. The editor was initially designed for creating dialogue trees to be used in videogames, however now I plan on expanding it to be a generalized node-based editor.
## Use Cases
A few of the use cases include visual scripting, visual shader scripting, dialog organization, and network visualization.
