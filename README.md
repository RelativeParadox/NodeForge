# NodeForge
NodeForge is a dynamic node editor built in python. The editor was initially designed for creating dialogue trees to be used in videogames, however now I plan on expanding it to be a generalized node-based editor. I plan on using electron-python to create a graphical interface, for now, it is all command line based.
## Dialog Trees
The primary purpose of NodeForge is to supply an easy to use and dynamic node editor to game designers. NodeForge has several features just for dialog trees including; Exporting to a film script, a simple scripting language, and a customizable JSON exporter.
## Videogame AI Logic
Exporting to GDScript, C#, and C++ planned.
## Neural Networking
I plan on adding TensorFlow support to NodeForge
## Other Use Cases
A few of the other use cases include visual scripting, visual shader scripting, notes organization, and network visualization.
